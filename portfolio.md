                <p>The Application Engineering team has been working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the past 10 years. In 2017 they migrated the Which?

            <dd>
                <p>Java has been the language predominantly used within the team, but in recent years Kotlin has been embraced and adopted as the language of choice. This has accelerated application development through the language's conciseness and reduced errors through its inherent null-safety.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>Spring Boot and the Spring Framework has been the defacto standard for developing enterprise Java applications for many years. The Application Engineering team were early adopters of Spring Boot whilst developing a secure card vault for a client. Since then, all existing projects were ported to Spring Boot, and it forms the basis of all new projects.</p>

            <dd>
                <p>A substantial part of the Which? CRM platform required the development of batch processes for the handling of inbound and outbound files to support third party systems. With a large number of batch jobs, the Application Engineering team developed a bespoke monitoring and management application. This application also included a mechanism for scheduling individual batch jobs that weren't triggered by thw presence of a file.</p>
